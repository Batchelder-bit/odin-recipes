        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The Oklahoma Fried Onion Burger is one of the “oldest, classic burgers in the world,” according to Cailan. 
                It was created in Oklahoma (obviously) during the Great Depression when meat was expensive but onions were 
                cheap—so making smash burgers meant they could use less of the expensive meat and more of the cheap veggie.</p>
        
            <p>The main reason the Oklahoma Fried Onion Burger remains a popular burger in the Sooner State and throughout 
                the U.S. is because it’s so simple, yet so delicious. It’s made with typical household ingredients and there 
                aren’t any bells and whistles—but the technique takes those basic ingredients to a new flavor level.</p>
